# 20_Epoch
Building MNIST model to run on only 25K and less params & achieve 95% and more accuracy with just 1 Epoch. Description This project demonstrates an innovative approach to training a machine learning model that achieves 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset in just 1 epoch. By leveraging efficient data preprocessing, model architecture optimization, and advanced initialization techniques, this project sets a new benchmark for speed and accuracy on MNIST. This model can serve as a foundation for tasks requiring rapid and resource-efficient training.
