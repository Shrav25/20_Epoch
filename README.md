# 20_Epoch
Building MNIST model to run on only 20K and less params & achieve 99% accuracy with 20 Epoch. 
Description This project demonstrates an innovative approach to training a machine learning model that achieves 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset in 20 epochs. By leveraging efficient data preprocessing, model architecture optimization, and advanced initialization techniques, this project sets a new benchmark for speed and accuracy on MNIST. This model can serve as a foundation for tasks requiring rapid and resource-efficient training.
